# Mixed Messages

## Description 
Mixed Messages is a program that displays a funny fictitious name, age of the person, <br>
and the quote said by the person in the terminal at random.

### Why Did I Build It?
The main motivation behind creating this short application is: 
- To store data in a proper format for easy retrieval
- To get comfortable working with arrays
- To write reusable functions

## How To Use?
To test out this application yourself, you need to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). <br><br>
Assuming that you have downloaded this repository on your device and Node, fire up the command prompt, <br>
change directories to the mixed messages directory and run the program using the command `node app.js`.
